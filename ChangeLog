    commit 993edd7891016caa04f738693dae75279198a595

    We no longer use the llink field as an integer at any point.
    We introduced a new field of treedepth to make it possible
    to know tree depth.
    A recent compiler identified cases of undefined
    behavior in using llink as an integer.
