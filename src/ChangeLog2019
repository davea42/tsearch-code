     * Makefile : adding more warning checks, leaving one
       out with an explanation.
     * config.h: Now creates ARGSUSED. Define HAVE_CONFIG_H 1
     * dwarf_tsearchbal.c,dwarf_tsearchbin.c,dwarf_tsearchepp.c,
       dwarf_tsearchred.c,tsearch_tester.c:
       Now with more places using (uintptr_t) to avoid
       warnings and with ARGSUSED in appropriate places.
       Ensured indents ok and no trailing whitespace.
