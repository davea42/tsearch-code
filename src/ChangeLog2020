    * tsearch_tester.c: Mostly the same codingstyle issues,
      but the call to  getline() in libc was coded
      in a way that violated the calling rules. 
      Unless one accidentally passed in a file name that
      lead to something with really long lines (ie, not
      a test in the testsuite) one would not notice. But still, it
      was wrong.  Now fixed.
    * RUNTEST: Now uses logic that lets the tests be meaningful
      while allowing the tests to PASS if all is well.
    * README: Now explains how to run the tests.

    * dwarf_tsearchbal.c,dwarf_tsearchbin.c,dwarf_tsearchepp.c,
      dwarf_tsearchhash.c,dwarf_tsearchred.c,tsearch.c,
      tsearch_tester.c: No logic changes, just altering
      to fit libdwarf codingstyle consisently, with
      no too-long lines.
    * tsearch.c: Same changes, codingstyle.
