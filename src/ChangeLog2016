     * tsearch/config.h: Add some things convenient for testing.
     * tsearch/dwarf_tsearch.c: Convenient for some testing.
     * dwarf_tsearch.h: Modifications aid in testing tsearch.

     * RUNTEST: the script had a couple of problems (typos). Fixed.
       Added comments about running the tests.
     * dwarf_tsearch.h: Provide a default DW_TSHASHTYPE
       for tsearchhash and use DW_TSHASHTYPE.
     * dwarf_tsearchbal.c,dwarf_tsearchbin.c,dwarf_tsearchepp.c,
       dwarf_tsearchred.c: Use DW_TSHASHTYPE.
     * dwarf_tsearchhash.c: use DW_TSHASHTYPE, add UNUSEDARG use.
       Now the primes list starts at 79, not 5 (the low numbers
       were really only for basic testing). Add UNUSEDARG
       though it is defined as empty here (it is for gcc
       to suppress some warnings).
     * tsearch_tester.c: Use DW_TSHASHTYPE.  Changed one
       error message to help match with input test files.

     * All .h, .c: Changed the return type of the hashfunc
       to be DW_TSHASHTYPE so it can easily be overridden.
       Unsigned long did not work well on a P64, IL32
       environment. Now it is easy to use -D to
       for folks in such an environment.

     * dwarf_tsearchbal.c: Deleted the unused little function rotatex().
2016-01-14  David Anderson
     * dwarf_tsearchtester.c: Fixed compilation warnings (some of them).
     * dwarf_tsearchbal.c: Added a comment.
